# **Weather Trend**
#### *Comparing Global Temperature vs San Francisco Temeprature*

**Project Goal:**

##### Key Consideration for deciding the trends:
  - Observing change in temperature over the years.
  - How city temperature varies with respect to global temperature?
  - Forecasting the city temperature for a known Global temperature value.
  - Comparing the change over the temperature with respect to overall average temperature through-out the years.
  - Finding the maximum and minimum average temperature for both city and global.
  - Relationship between the city and global temperature.
  
##### Generating data:
- Generate temperature data for city and Global using `MySQL`.
- Downlaoded `csv file` and save as an `Excel file`.

##### Analysis:
- For this project, Calculate Moving Averages.
                    - For each year calculate the `Arithmetic Mean` that is taken from the past 9years plus the current year.
- Generate good fit for this data.
- Using Graphical Representations conslusions are drawn.
